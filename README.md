A **low-cost, dual-hazard security system** built around an ESP32 microcontroller. It detects **flames** and **door opening events** (intrusion) using IR-based sensors and communicates **system status** (`ARMED`, `DISARMED`, `RESET`, `HELP`) to your smartphone via Bluetooth.

## 📡 Bluetooth Commands & Status Messages

The ESP32 communicates over **Bluetooth Serial (SPP)** at **9600 baud**.

### 🔹 Commands you can send from your phone:

| Command     | Action                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HELP`      | System replies with a summary of all available commands               |
| `ARM`       | Arms the system – intrusion and flame monitoring is active            |
| `DISARM`    | Disarms the system – no alerts will be triggered                      |
| `RESET`     | Resets the system (clears alerts, returns to last armed/disarmed state)|

### 🔹 Status messages sent by the ESP32:

| Message                     | Meaning                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `SYSTEM ARMED`              | System is active and monitoring              |
| `SYSTEM DISARMED`           | System is inactive                           |
| `FLAME DETECTED!`           | Fire hazard detected                         |
| `INTRUSION DETECTED!`       | Door was opened (object removed from sensor) |
| `SYSTEM RESET`              | Reset command acknowledged                   |
| `HELP - Commands: ARM, DISARM, RESET, HELP` | Command summary |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intrusion-flame-security.git
cd intrusion-flame-security

```

### 2. Install PlatformIO (recommended) or Arduino IDE
•PlatformIO – VS Code extension

•Or Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support


### 3. Upload the code
Open the project and upload the main sketch to your ESP32.

### 4. Pair your smartphone
  •Enable Bluetoooth on your phone
  
  •Pair with ESP32_Security (or custom name)
  
  •Open a blueetooth serial app and connect

### 5. Test the system

  •Send HELP – you should receive the command list
  
  •Send ARM – system starts monitoring
  
  •🔥 Flame test – bring a lighter near the flame sensor → buzzer + LED + alert
  
  •🚪 Door test – place an object in front of the IR sensor (door CLOSED), then remove it (door OPEN) → intrusion alert
  
  •Send DISARM – system stops alerts
  
  •Send RESET – clears any active alert state
  


## 🔐 How Intrusion Detection Works

  •The MH Flying Fish IR sensor continuously emits IR light and looks for reflection.
  
  •When a door is closed, an object (e.g., cardboard, wood panel) is placed directly in front of the sensor → IR reflects back → sensor reads LOW (door present).
  
  •When the door is opened, the object is removed → no IR reflection → sensor reads HIGH → intrusion triggered.
  
  •This mimics a real door monitoring system: if the door is opened without disarming, an alert is raised.

## 🧪 Lessons Learned

  •Door simulation: Using a physical object to represent a closed door works reliably, but sensor positioning is critical.
  
  •Sensor tuning – potentiometers must be adjusted to detect presence/absence without false triggers.
  
  •Arming logic – alerts should only trigger when ARMED; DISARMED ignores all sensors.
  
  •Command parsing – Bluetooth input must handle line endings (\n, \r\n) correctly.
  
  •Debouncing – brief delays prevent multiple rapid intrusion events on door open.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

  •📡 Wi-Fi + Cloud alerts (Telegram, Blynk, or Firebase)
  
  •📱 Custom mobile app with ARM/DISARM buttons and alert history
  
  •🔑 PIN code authentication before disarming
  
  •📷 Camera module to capture image on intrusion
  
  •🔋 Battery backup for power outages
  
  •🧠 Multiple zones – monitor several doors with one system
